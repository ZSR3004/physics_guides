\section{Introduction}
This study guide is for General Physics I \& II. It covers basically all of the material in these courses. I can't guarantee it is all correct, but
I think it's fairly comprehensive. I took that course during \textbf{Fall 2024 \& Spring 2025} semesters, so that's when it was last updated. Material
could have changed or been moved around since then. Also, just to flag, the material is not in the order that it was taught the year I took it. I
grouped it based on concepts, rather than whatever the class does which I think is difficultly. As a result, you might encounter a really difficult
topic out of nowhere. For example, Forces and Torques are similar concepts, but Forces is the second chapter and Torques is one of the last in the class.
Despite that, I've decided to group them simply \textit{because} they are similar topics. With that out of the way, I hope you find this guide helpful!
