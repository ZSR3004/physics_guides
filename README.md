# Study Guides Repo

This is a repo for study guides I've made while taking classes in university. The best way to use these study guides is to download them onto your computer because, for some reason, the links don't work if you view them on GitHub.

Most of the links are internal and act as a way to take you to a related section (like in the table of contents or to an appendix). For most of these, I'll update them from time to time, but when I'm done with that class and have stopped updating it, I'll likely make a note about it.

## General How-to-Use
Folders are either a class name or a subject. Inside each one will be a bunch of files, one of which is a pdf. The pdf is the actual study guide, the rest of the files are related to how the study guide is made and aren't super important.
